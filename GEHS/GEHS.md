# What is GE:H&S?


Google Earth: Hide and Seek (or a shortened GEHS for legal reasons) is a digitalized version of Hide and Seek using Google Earth Pro.

Using a combination of clues to do a process of elimination the player looks to find the hider within a specified timeframe (Initial test is for a week). The player can use various means of transportation (Planes, Trains, Cars, and Busses) to get closer to where the hider is. Clues in addition to the "estimated" length of time to get from one point to another will count against the timeframe the user has. Each clue will have an initial time cost that will increase with each sequential use (Not all clues can be used more than once due to how they are designed). 

At any point the seeker can guess but when the remaining time is close enough to where a clue will force them over alloted time they will be forced to guess. This is partially countered where they can receive assistance from viewers in the form of Streamloots cards with ones to lower the amount of time they have spent along with being able to ask for clues without the time penalty.

Depending on the distance the person is from the hiding spot will determine the amount of points they receive. 100 miles or closer and they receive 1000 points with the number increasing the closer they are. Anything outside of that is automatically 100 points regardless of distance.
